<p>Provides the classes required to support concurrent requests to resources.
This package contains various classes including a Singleton (ChannelManager) that 
governs all incoming requests and returns the resource when it becomes available.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>Provides the classes required to perform concurrent resource requests to a number of channels.
Each <code>Channel</code> object is unique based upon the request properties it is responsible for providing a resource to. The 
<code>ChannelHost</code> object is responsible for retrieving the resource and applying it to the channel.
</p>
<p>When a channel has returned a resource to its last requesting <code>ChannelSubscriber</code> an attempt to 
perform a cleanup of the channel is initiated via a <code>ChannelRecycler</code> object.
</br>
If no further requests to that channel are received within a specified time frame, the <code>Channel</code> will be recycled.
If a request synonymous to that channel is received within the time frame the recycling process is cancelled.
