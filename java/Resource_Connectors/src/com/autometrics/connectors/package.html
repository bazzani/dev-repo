Provides the classes required to create and use data connectors.

This package contains various classes and interfaces, including a Factory class that will instantiate 
and return an implementation of the <code>IDataConnector</code> interface which all data connectors must implement.


<h2>Package Specification</h2>
Provides the classes required to construct data connectors.

Data connectors provide an interface to connect to a variety of data sources within the Autometrics platform.

The <code>DataConnectorFactory</code> class has a number of static properties defining the valid data connectors available in the current version, and it is a good first point of reference.
